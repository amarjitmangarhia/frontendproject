                <p>HandyMan has been the expert on how your world functions since 1909. We provide our readers with the
                    most recent information and resources on inventions and innovations in the automotive,
                    do-it-yourself, science, technology, and outdoor realms. We also provide our readers with the
                    information they need to make the most of life, such as how to build a farmhouse table or repair a
                    tyre. In Popular Mechanics, getting your hands dirty is encouraged as well as amazement and
                    curiosity about the world around you.</p>

                <p>In 1642, a student of mathematics, William Oughtred, proposed a design for a circular saw to cut wood
                    without fail. At this point, the circular saw was not so much an invention as it was a concept
                    developed similarly and independently throughout Europe.</p>
